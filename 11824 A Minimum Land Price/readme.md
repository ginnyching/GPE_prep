## Summary  
The price increases in the exponential growth curves by a factor of year.   
If the land **i** whose initial cost is Li.  
Bought in t years from now, its price will be 2*(Li)^t.  
Find a way to buy the lands at lowest price within the
budget of 5,000,000.  

## Strategy  
Sort the land descending, and count the total budget needed.  

## Technique  
`sort`  
`power(Li,t)`=Li^t
