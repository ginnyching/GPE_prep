## Summary  
Find the number that make the summation of absolute deviation from the sequence is minimum.  

## Strategy  
Find the **median** of the sequence.  
If the sequence contains even numbers, there will be 2 medians.  
**Any nuumber in between 2 medians will satisfy the minimum summation.**
