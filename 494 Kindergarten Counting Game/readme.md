## Summary  
Count how many words there are.  
A “word” is defined as a consecutive sequence of letters.  

## Strategy  
- method_1  
split the original string by space and check if each string is a "word".  
**careful of the type \\word\\word.**  
- method_2  
deal with the original string directly.  

## Technique  
`substr()` and `str.find()` from \\<cstring\\>
