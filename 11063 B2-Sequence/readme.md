## Summary  
Check if the input sequence is a B2-sequence.  
A B2-sequence is defined as a sequence of positive integers 1≤b1<b2<b3 such that all pairwise sums bi +bj are different, where i ≤ j.  

## Strategy  
Beside checking the pairwise sums, the **order** of the sequence and the **sign** of value also determine if the sequence is a B2-sequence.  

## Technique  
find occurence in map if `map.count()>0`
